ChWiSe.Net
==========

ChWiSe.Net is "Chemical Wikipedia Search". It is servlet-based web-application which provides mixed text/chemical-structures search in
english wikipedia articles describing chemical compounds.

It is based on my other project [Chemical Lucene](https://github.com/AlexanderSavochkin/MolecularLucene). This project contains web-interface and wikipedia dump proceesing and indexing stuff.
